AdventurerEffect Bug Report
===========================
Title: AdventurerEffect causing seg fault / buffer overrun

Class: Serious Bug

Date: 2017-08-03
Reported By: Jonathan Horton
Email: hortonjo@oregonstate.edu

Product: Dominion Game
Platform: flip


Description
===========
Adventurer effect occasionally runs out of cards when searching
the deck and keeps going into other computer memory. Having gold
in the deck seems to lessen the problem.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
-------------------------
1. Initialize game with a deck with few or no treasure cards
2. Call AdventurerEffect
3. Seg fault is reported and program terminates


Expected Results
----------------
Adventurer searches deck for treasure cards and adds them to the
current player's hand, if found. Otherwise the card simply
discards itself.


Actual Results
--------------
Program either crashes or has unpredictable behavior, sometimes
adding or subtracting large numbers of cards.


Workarounds
-----------
Having a deck built of gold works a bit better for some reason, 
though the card still doesn't discard itself at the end.
